# ReactionMenu
Written by @cloudrac3r (A.K.A. Cadence), this module is a reaction handler for ThunderStorm to easily create menus which are highly customizable.

## Requirements
This module requires AmandaDiscord/Thunderstorm.

## Note
There is a static method handler which accepts data which is emitted from ThunderStorm but not all data is compatible. You will just need to get the user's data somehow.
